## Generate a relevant example:

Let’s create some simulated data. First I’ll generate x, then an error
sampled from a normal distribution, and then a response y; this all gets
stored in sim_df_const. Then I’ll modify this by multiplying the errors
by a term that involves x, and create a new response variable y.

``` r
n_samp = 250

sim_df_const = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(n_samp, 1, 1),
    error = rnorm(n_samp, 0, 1),
    y = 2 + 3 * x + error
  )

sim_df_nonconst = sim_df_const %>% 
  mutate(
  error = error * .75 * x,
  y = 2 + 3 * x + error
)
```

By generating data in this way, I’m creating one case in which the usual
linear regression assumptions hold and one case in which they don’t.

The plot below illustrates the differences between the dataset:

``` r
sim_df = 
  bind_rows(const = sim_df_const, nonconst = sim_df_nonconst, .id = "data_source") 

sim_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_grid(~data_source) 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](bootstrapping_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- --> These
datasets have roughly the same overall variance, but the left panel
shows data with constant variance and the right panel shows data with
non-constant variance. For this reason, ordinary least squares should
provide reasonable estimates in both cases, but inference is standard
inference approaches may only be justified for the data on the left.

The output below shows results from fitting simple linear regressions to
both datasets:

``` r
lm(y ~ x, data = sim_df_const) |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term        | estimate | std.error | statistic | p.value |
|:------------|---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept) |    1.977 |     0.098 |    20.157 |       0 |
| x           |    3.045 |     0.070 |    43.537 |       0 |

Despite the very different error structures, standard errors for
coefficient estimates are similar in both cases! – We’ll use the
bootstrap to make inference for the data on the right. This is intended
largely as an illustration for how to use the bootstrap in cases where
the theoretical distribution is “unknown”, although for these data in
particular weighted least squares could be more appropriate.

# Drawing one bootstrap sample

Let’s write a quick function to generate our bootstrap samples. This
function should have the data frame as the argument, and should return a
sample from that dataframe drawn with replacement.

``` r
boot_sample = function(df) {
  sample_frac(df, replace = TRUE)
}
```

We should also do a quick check to see if this is working:

``` r
boot_sample(sim_df_nonconst) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](bootstrapping_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- --> This
plot looks about right. In comparison with the original data, the
bootstrap sample has the same characteristics but isn’t a perfect
duplicate – some original data points appear more than once, others
don’t appear at all.

# Drawing many bootstrap samples

We’re going to draw repeated samples with replacement, and then analyze
each of those samples separately. It would be really great to have a
data structure that makes it possible to keep track of everything. Like
a list column!!!

Lets give it a try:

``` r
boot_straps = 
  tibble(strap_number = 1:1000) |> 
  mutate(
    strap_sample = map(strap_number, \(i) boot_sample(df = sim_df_nonconst))
  )

boot_straps
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,000 × 2
    ##    strap_number strap_sample      
    ##           <int> <list>            
    ##  1            1 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  2            2 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  3            3 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  4            4 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  5            5 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  6            6 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  7            7 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  8            8 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ##  9            9 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ## 10           10 <tibble [250 × 3]>
    ## # ℹ 990 more rows

We can do a few of quick checks to make sure this has worked as
intended. First we’ll look at a couple of bootstrap samples:

``` r
boot_straps |> 
  slice(1:3) |> 
  mutate(strap_sample = map(strap_sample, arrange, x)) |> 
  pull(strap_sample)
```

    ## # ℹ 240 more rows

This seems okay – some values are repeated, some don’t appear in both
datasets.

Next I’ll use ggplot to show some of these datasets, and to include a
linear fit for each:

``` r
boot_straps |> 
  slice(1:3) |> 
  unnest(strap_sample) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~strap_number) 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](bootstrapping_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- --> This
shows some of the differences across bootstrap samples, and shows that
the fitted regression lines aren’t the same for every bootstrap sample.
